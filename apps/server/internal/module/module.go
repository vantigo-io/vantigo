// Package module is the platform every business module (identity, customers,
// products, energy, communications) mounts through: a router that enforces
// each operation's x-vantigo-access rule and rate limit at runtime, a
// Compose that assembles the modules under /api, and a Workers (workers.go)
// that collects the background workers the enabled modules contribute for
// cmd/vantigo's worker runner to start.
